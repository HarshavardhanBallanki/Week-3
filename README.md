## 🔍 Problem Statement

To develop a machine learning pipeline that predicts carbon emissions based on various contributing factors. The model is trained on preprocessed and cleaned environmental data.

## ✅ Key Tasks Completed

# 📊 Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
Used NumPy and Pandas to load, inspect, and clean raw data.

Handled missing values and removed inconsistencies.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends.

# 🤖 Model Building
Applied regression models to predict carbon emission levels.

Evaluated performance using metrics like R² score, MSE, etc.

Utilized Scikit-learn for training and validating the models.

# 🧪 Experimentation
Tuned hyperparameters to improve model performance.

Compared multiple models to choose the best-performing one.

## 📌 Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn
